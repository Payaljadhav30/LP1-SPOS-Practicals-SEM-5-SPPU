## üöÄ How to Run Java Practicals

You can run the programs in **two ways**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inside the practical folder (simple way)
1. Navigate to the folder of the practical you want to run:
```bash
cd pract1
```
2. Compile the Java program:
```bash
javac Pass1.java
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
java Pass1
```

Works for simple practicals. If this does not work, use Method 2 below.

1. Stay in the main folder: Ex.
```bash
cd C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\SPOS_PRACT

```
2. Compile the Java program by specifying the folder:
```bash
javac pract8\BestFit.java
```

3. Run the program using the folder as a package:
```bash
java pract8.BestFit
```

Recommended if your practicals are inside subfolders. Works for all Pract1 ‚Üí Pract10.


üîπ Quick Steps to Run Practicals

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/Payaljadhav30/LP1-SPOS-Practicals-SEM-5-SPPU.git

2. Navigate to Folder
cd pract1

3. Compile and Run by any suitable method from given 2 methods
